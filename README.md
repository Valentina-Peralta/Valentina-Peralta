#  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm Valentina, web developer and mathematics teacher.

##  ðŸ‘€ About me
I enjoy creating solutions and developing successful digital experiences that exceed expectations. With a natural curiosity for unraveling how things work, I constantly seek the best solutions to problems.

Driven by a strong belief that knowledge empowers and a deep desire to make the world a better place, I initially pursued a career as a mathematics teacher. However, I later decided to merge my creativity and analytical thinking, which led me to discover the limitless world of programming.
